            <h2> <u>Future Aims and Aspirations</u></h2>
                <h4>As I grow professionally, I aim to become an entrepreneur and aspire, lead and guide a team towards making a significant contribution in the field of healthcare. 
                    I have already started taking steps towards a successful entrepreneurial journey by participating in various intra and inter school competitions and also organising various competitions and events. This has significantly helped me in developing my problem solving, and critical thinking skills which I believe are the core skillset of every entrepreneur. 
                    Besides this, I have also started reading novels on entrepreneurship, studying financial journals and reviewing the world of start-up followed by self-help books. This will help me in developing a mindset as an entrepreneur. I have also stared to search through a wide range of content about entrepreneurship focusing on successful and unsuccessful companies, followed by attending webinars and conferences with people already into the corporate world. This has helped me to gain broader and precise insights of the corporate world.
